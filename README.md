# Quantum-Symphony
Repository for "Quantum Symphony" as a part of WnCC Seasons of Code '24!

Plan of Action: 

Week 1: Basics of Quantum mechanics and linear Algebra, Introduction to qubits, qiskits  \n
Week 2: Quantum Gates and Circuits, Phase kickback, QFT
Week 3: Quantum Algorithms
Week 4 & 5: Introduction to Deep Learning/ Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
Week 6: Introduction to QML,
Release of Mid-term Assignment
Week 7: More on QNN/QRL
Week 8/9: Implementing Research papers

The relevant resources and some basic coding or theoretical tasks for the kth week will be shared by Sunday E.O.D. of the (k-1)th week.
*Another Important thing*: 
Even though we will share with you various resources, the main resources for at least the Quantum Computing parts will be 
1. QCQI by Isaac Chuang and Michael Nielsen (PDF below)
2. IBMâ€™s online qiskit textbook: https://learning.quantum.ibm.com
