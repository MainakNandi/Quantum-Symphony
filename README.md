# Quantum-Symphony
Repository for "Quantum Symphony" as a part of WnCC Seasons of Code '24!

Plan of Action: 

1. Week 1: Basics of Quantum mechanics and linear Algebra, Introduction to qubits, qiskit
2. Week 2: Quantum Gates and Circuits, Phase kickback, QFT
3. Week 3: Quantum Algorithms
4. Week 4 & 5: Introduction to Deep Learning/ Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
5. Week 6: Introduction to QML,
6. Release of Mid-term Assignment
7. Week 7: More on QNN/QRL
8. Week 8/9: Implementing Research papers

The relevant resources and some basic coding or theoretical tasks for the kth week will be shared by Sunday E.O.D. of the (k-1)th week.
*Another Important thing*: 
Even though we will share with you various resources, the main resources for at least the Quantum Computing parts will be 
1. QCQI by Isaac Chuang and Michael Nielsen (https://profmcruz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-nielsen-chuang.pdf)
2. IBMâ€™s online qiskit textbook: https://learning.quantum.ibm.com
