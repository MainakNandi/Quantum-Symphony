Hi everyone, let's get started!
For the first week, we will mostly focus on laying the foundations for the upcoming weeks. Though it may seem a little boring but believe us, it will make your upcoming weeks much easier.
So your task for the first week is:

From QCQI: 
Chapter 2- Section 2.1, Section 2.2 (Mainly till evolution)
Chapter 1- Section 1.2

After that, you can check out IBM learning resources. It has both text and videos so you can choose whatever you prefer.
Also, for some introduction to the qiskit library, you can check out the 'qiskit examples' from the below -

https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/multiple-systems

For those having some difficulties learning from the above, the video below explains the major topics quite nicely:

You can just skim through them to get an idea, it's okay if you feel a little overwhelmed, the continuous usage of these concepts in the upcoming weeks will make you feel more comfortable.
