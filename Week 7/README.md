Hello Everyone, We are finally in the last phase of our project! Thanks to everyone for sticking with us till now.
So without further delay, lets dive into the world of Quantum Machine Learning!
1. For some introduction, you can look into the following two publications: (a) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3097 (b) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09510
  Note: You do not need to go through every line, just get a flavour of it. If you have done QC and ML part properly you can sail safely in the following weeks.
2. Now, lets code some QML. The best tool available for beginners out there is Pennylane, its a library much like qiskit so you won't have a tough time following its tutorials. You can download it from here: https://pennylane.ai
3. The most basic tutorial, or some call it, The hello world of QML, is the Qubit Rotation! You can find it here: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation/

A google form will be floated by the end of the week and you can submit a copy of your implementation of the above tutorial. Make sure to comment and customize it as much as possible!
For the remaining weeks, we will be implementing some more complicated problems.
