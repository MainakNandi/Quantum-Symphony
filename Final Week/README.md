Hello Everyone, Firstly I would like to thank everyone who is still with us. 
Now as for the final piece of our project, we will be giving you three research papers.
We will also be sharing their implementation since the deadline is near but we highly recommend you to first read the paper thoroughly and take reference from the implementation.

1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02085 (Implementation: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_data_reuploading_classifier/)
2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06201 (Implementation: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_gans/)
3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3061 (Implementation: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/)

You need to submit an ipynb file implementing any one of the above papers.
Just copying the code will not be accepted. The Markdown feature is your friend! Use it wisely to maximise your points.
