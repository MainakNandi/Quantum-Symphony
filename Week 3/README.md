Hello everyone, It is finally time to delve deep into Quantum Algorithms to see the power of quantum principles we have learned so far.
This week we will be learning the following famous algorithms:
1. The Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
2. The Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm
3. Simon's Algorithm
You can find these algorithms on this page of the qiskit learning library:

Then we will focus on some advanced algorithms
1. First we have Shor's algorithm with quantum Phase estimation as the prerequisite. You can find it here:
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring#shors-algorithm
2. And finally Grover's Search Algorithm which can be found here:
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/grovers-algorithm

I would strongly recommend watching the videos in these pages and asking doubts as these topics can be quite intimidating.
