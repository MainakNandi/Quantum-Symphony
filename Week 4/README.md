# Introduction to Machine Learning
Hi everyone, let us start with the second phase of our project, Machine Learning.
For starters, I expect everyone to have some basic knowledge of ML before diving into other topics like Deep Learning or Reinforcement Learning.
1. To get a flavour of ML, You can watch the first eight videos of the following playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU
2. Also, for smooth learning in the upcoming weeks try to complete the following playlist till tutorial 14th ASAP: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4
   
Note that, we expect you to complete the first task by the end of Thursday so that we can move on to more advanced tasks.
By the end of these tasks, you should have a foundational understanding of Machine Learning, which will be essential for tackling more advanced topics in the upcoming weeks.

# Neural Networks 

Now that we've mastered the basics of machine learning, it's time to dive deepâ€”literally! Buckle up because we're headed into the thrilling depths of Deep Learning

Complete the course [Neural Networks and Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0) by Andrew Ng
It'll give you a solid understanding of Deep Learning and a clear view of how neural networks actually work.
