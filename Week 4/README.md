# Introduction to Machine Learning
Hi everyone, let us start with the second phase of our project, Machine Learning.
For starters, I expect everyone to have some basic knowledge of ML before diving into other topics like Deep Learning or Reinforcement Learning.
1. To get a flavour of ML, You can watch the first eight videos of the following playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU
2. Also, for smooth learning in the upcoming weeks try to complete the following playlist till tutorial 14th ASAP: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4
   
Note that, we expect you to complete the first task by the end of Thursday so that we can move on to more advanced tasks.
