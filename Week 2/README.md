Hello everyone, Hope you all are doing well!

After a week full of Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra principles we are more than qualified to dive into Quantum Computing.

For Starters, Lets us begin by getting ourselves familiar with Quantum gates and Quantum Circuits, the heart of Quantum Computing.

From QCQI:
1. Chapter 1: Section 1.3 (To get an overview of what we are getting into)
2. Chapter 4: Secton 4.2 - Section 4.5 (Mainly till 4.5.2 only)
From Qiskit Textbook: (Go there only after reading the above the resources, since there's not much introduction on gates)
1. https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits (Read this fully, since I skipped some concepts on POVMS in the first week since as it was getting too heavy)

Now after you have a good grasp of Quantum gates and Circuits, Lets prepare ourselves for the next week which is primarily focused on Quantum Algorithms.

The following two topics are used in almost every quantum algorithm in different forms:
1. QFT:
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring#quantum-fourier-transform (The topic Quantum Fourier Transform)
2. Phase kickback: It explains the concept of Phase kickback as well as implements a simple quantum algorithm whose much advanced version will be covered next week.
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms#deutschs-algorithm (The topic Deutsch's Algorithm till Implementation)

An Assignment testing your understanding of Week 1 & 2 will also be released near the end of this week with appropiate deadline. It will have both theory as well as coding part.

Happy Learning!
