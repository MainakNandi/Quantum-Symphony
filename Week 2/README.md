Hello everyone, Hope you all are doing well!

After a week full of Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra principles we are more than qualified to dive into Quantum Computing.

For Starters, let us begin by familiarising ourselves with Quantum gates and Quantum Circuits, the heart of Quantum Computing.

From QCQI:
1. Chapter 1: Section 1.3 (To get an overview of what we are getting into)
2. Chapter 4: Section 4.2 - Section 4.5 (Mainly till 4.5.2 only)
   
From Qiskit Textbook: (Go there only after reading the above resources, since there's not much introduction on gates)
1. https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits (Read this fully, since I skipped some concepts on POVMS in the first week since as it was getting too heavy)

Now that you have a good grasp of Quantum gates and Circuits, Let's prepare ourselves for the next week which is primarily focused on Quantum Algorithms.

The following two topics are used in almost every quantum algorithm in different forms:
1. QFT:
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring#quantum-fourier-transform (The topic Quantum Fourier Transform)
2. Phase kickback: It explains the concept of Phase kickback and implements a simple quantum algorithm whose much-advanced version will be covered next week.
https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms#deutschs-algorithm (The topic Deutsch's Algorithm till Implementation)

An Assignment testing your understanding of Weeks 1 & 2 will also be released near the end of this week with an appropriate deadline. It will have both theory as well as coding parts.

Happy Learning!
